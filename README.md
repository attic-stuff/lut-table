imagine every possible color in your game was in this cool spinning cube of pretty candy colors. but then you're like "well heck i wish my game had different colors" but you were also like "aw crap i donut have time to recolor my whole ass game." the solution to that problem is color grading and palette swapping. for small things, palette swapping is pretty great and useful, you just say "okay game replace all black pixels with green pixels" and be done with it. for more complex color grading you need to use either a bunch of math (yuck!) or a lookup table. an example of a complex need for color grading would be a good day-to-night cycle.
