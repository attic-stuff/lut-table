# lut table

#### color grading shader for gamemaker that uses a table of lookup tables. its a lookup table table.

<img align="left" width="100%" src="https://github.com/attic-stuff/lut-table/blob/main/timelapse.gif">color grading is a pretty important aspect of your game's tech art pipeline. if you've ever tried a day/night cycle with blendmodes or drawing rectangles over the screen you know it can get ugly or slow fast. this is true of doing other kinds of grading too; you can make your game greyscale with a single line of glsl but you dont get the benefit of dramatic contrast and brightness adjustments. lut table is a shader that solves that problemâ€”it samples a whole table full of color luts and allows you to interpolate between them like some kind of color correcting god.

| sampler2d table                                              |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| this is the lookup table table. it must be on its own texture page, and it must be a power of two sized texture. that means if you have seven tables, your texture must be sized 512x512. this seems bad, to have a lot of blank space. its fine. |

| vec2 parameters                                              |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| parameters.x is the **resolution** of your look up table. we've been looking at luts with are resolution of 16, meaning each slice of our cube is 16x16 pixels. this shader supports luts with resolutions of 16, 32, and 64 |
| parameters.y is the **number of tables** on the table.  this is not the number of present luts it is the number of possible luts. it should always be your (power of two) lut table height divided by the resolution. |

| vec4 instructions                                            |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| instructions.x is table **A** to use for the color grading.  |
| instructions.y is table **B** to use for the color grading.  |
| instructions.z is the **table mix** between A and B.         |
| instructions.w is the **frame mix**; which is how much we mix the final table mix with the scene |

### examples

##### example 1: combining two lookup tables for a day/night cycle

in the project file you will find a pre made lut table, and on it there is 9 luts. these are zero-index (first one is 0 not 1) 0 through 8 right? well if we use lut 3 and lut 8 we can make a pretty cool day to night timer.
```js
/* C R E A T E EVENT */
application_surface_draw_enable(false);

//lets call our time minute and day. 18000 frames is about five minutes
//and are gunna count minutes until minutes is equal to day
day = 18000;
minute = 0;

//lets setup some uniforms
uniforms = array_create(3);
uniforms[0] = shader_get_sampler_index(pp_luttable, "table");
uniforms[1] = shader_get_uniform(pp_luttable, "parameters");
uniforms[2] = shader_get_uniform(pp_luttable, "instructions");
//x16 is the name of our lut table
texture = sprite_get_texture(x16, 0);
//it uses 16x16 slices of color
resolution = 16;
//this has to be the to
tables = sprite_get_height(x16) / resolution;

//set up our instructions
A = 3;
B = 8;
//initially table A should be the only color grading present
//and we will change this over time to make it night
tablemix = 0.0;
framemix = 1.0;

/* S T E P EVENT */
//count minutes
if (minute < day) {
    minute += 1;
}
//figure out how much of the day has passed
var p = minute / day;
//this percentage is how much we mix table B into table A
//so when 0 minutes has passed we will be fully table A, when minutes is
//9000 then we will be 50% A and 50% B, etc etc
tablemix = p;

/* P O S T  D R A W EVENT */
shader_set(pp_luttable) {
	texture_set_stage(u[0], texture);
	shader_set_uniform_f(u[1], resolution, tables);
	shader_set_uniform_f(u[2], A, B, tablemix, framemix);
	gpu_set_tex_filter_ext(u[0], true);
	draw_surface(application_surface, 0, 0);
	gpu_set_tex_filter_ext(u[0], false);
	shader_reset();
}
```

##### example 2, using a single lut to color grade a surface

maybe you want to draw a bunch of cool stuff to a surface and give it a %50 color grade using just a single table

```js
/* C R E A T E EVENT */
application_surface_draw_enable(false);

//lets setup some uniforms
uniforms = array_create(3);
uniforms[0] = shader_get_sampler_index(pp_luttable, "table");
uniforms[1] = shader_get_uniform(pp_luttable, "parameters");
uniforms[2] = shader_get_uniform(pp_luttable, "instructions");
//x16 is the name of our lut table
texture = sprite_get_texture(x16, 0);
//it uses 16x16 slices of color
resolution = 16;
//this has to be the to
tables = sprite_get_height(x16) / resolution;

//set up our instructions
A = 2;
B = 2;
//set A and B to the same index, then set the frame mix to 50%.
tablemix = 1.0;
framemix = 0.5;

/* P O S T  D R A W EVENT */
shader_set(pp_luttable) {
	texture_set_stage(u[0], texture);
	shader_set_uniform_f(u[1], resolution, tables);
	shader_set_uniform_f(u[2], A, B, tablemix, framemix);
	gpu_set_tex_filter_ext(u[0], true);
	draw_surface(application_surface, 0, 0);
	gpu_set_tex_filter_ext(u[0], false);
	shader_reset();
}
```
